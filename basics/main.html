    <h1>How <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> Can Help You Create Something</h1>
    <ol>
    <h2><li>Organize Your Thoughts</li></h2>
    <p>Organize Your Thoughts Every great creation starts with an idea.<br>In Notion, you can capture thoughts quickly in pages, then organize them with databases, tags, and links.<br>
    This helps you see the bigger picture while keeping track of small details.</p>
    <h2><li>Build Workflows Your Way</li></h2>
    <p>Unlike traditional tools, Notion is customizable.<br>You can create a simple checklist or design a full project management board.<br>This freedom allows you to shape your workspace exactly how your project needs it.</p>
    <h2><li>Keep Resources in One Place</li></h2>
    <p>Inspiration often comes from multiple sources: articles, images, or research notes.<br>Notion lets you store all of these in one connected system, so you never lose track of what matters.</p>
    <h2><li>Turn Ideas Into Action</li></h2>
    <p>Once your vision is clear, you can break it down into tasks and deadlines.<br>Notion helps you move from brainstorming to execution, making sure your ideas donâ€™t just stay on paper.</p>
